# CLI Calculator (Python)

## Project Overview

This project is a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Calculator** built using Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**. The program uses a menu-driven approach and runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.
## Features

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division (with zero-division error handling)
* Continuous loop until exit
* Exit option
